# Patent Assessment Platform

**AI-Powered Patent Assessment Web Application**  
*From concept to $10K+ MRR in 90 days*

## 🎯 Project Status: **Planning → Execution**

This project evolved from a SuperClaude brainstorming session into a comprehensive business plan with technical implementation roadmap.

## 📚 Project Documentation

- **`BRAINSTORMING_SESSION.md`** - Complete brainstorming analysis with multi-stream exploration
- **`90_DAY_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`** - Detailed 90-day roadmap with weekly tasks and milestones
- **`WARP.md`** - Development guidelines and project context for AI assistants

## 🚀 Core Vision

Web application that assesses patent potential of projects through:
- **File upload** with project descriptions
- **AI agent screening** of patent databases  
- **Assessment** according to patent criteria (novelty, non-obviousness, utility)
- **Automated document drafting** for positive cases

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 + TypeScript + FastAPI + PostgreSQL + OpenAI GPT-4  
**Approach:** Monolith-first for rapid MVP, scale to microservices  
**Deployment:** Railway/Render with auto-scaling  
**AI Strategy:** Multi-agent coordination with specialized roles  

## 💰 Business Model

- **Phase 1 (Days 1-30):** Free beta testing and product validation
- **Phase 2 (Days 31-60):** Freemium launch ($49/month premium) → $1K MRR
- **Phase 3 (Days 61-90):** Enterprise tier ($299/month) → $10K+ MRR

## 📊 Success Metrics (Day 90)

- ✅ **500+ beta users** with active engagement
- ✅ **$10K+ MRR** from premium subscriptions  
- ✅ **2+ strategic partnerships** signed
- ✅ **Production infrastructure** handling 100+ concurrent assessments

## 🛠️ SuperClaude Framework

This project was developed using SuperClaude's parallel brainstorming capabilities:
- **Multi-stream analysis** across technical, business, and legal domains
- **Systematic exploration** with specialized AI agents
- **Cross-session persistence** for complex planning sessions
- **Convergence methodology** from ideation to executable roadmap

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review** the 90-day execution plan
2. **Set up** development environment (Week 1)
3. **Begin** MVP implementation sprint
4. **Execute** the systematic roadmap to launch
