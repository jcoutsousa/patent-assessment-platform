# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a SuperClaude Test Project designed for exploring SuperClaude framework capabilities. SuperClaude extends Claude Code with specialized capabilities including behavioral modes, specialized AI agents, MCP server integrations, and enhanced command system.

## Repository Structure

This is currently a minimal repository serving as a testing ground for SuperClaude features. The project structure will evolve as features are explored and implemented.

## Development Commands

Since this is a test project for exploring SuperClaude framework capabilities, specific build/test commands will be added as the project structure develops.

### Git Operations

## Architecture Notes

This repository serves as an experimental environment for:
- Testing SuperClaude behavioral modes
- Exploring specialized AI agent integrations
- Experimenting with MCP server capabilities
- Developing enhanced command systems

As features are implemented, this section will be updated with architectural patterns and component relationships.

## Development Guidelines

- This is an active testing environment - expect rapid iteration
- New features should be documented as they're implemented
- Experiments should be tracked through git commits with descriptive messages

## Next Steps

The project is in its initial phase. Consider adding:
- Source code structure for SuperClaude experiments
- Configuration files for MCP server integrations
- Test scripts for behavioral mode validation
- Documentation for specialized AI agent implementations
